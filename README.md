## About UNC

UNC's purpose is to enable community-driven innovation to benefit people around the world.

To achieve this purpose, *UNC* provides a developer platform where developers and entrepreneurs can create apps that put users back in control of their data and assets, which is the foundation of ["Open Web" movement][open-web-url].

One of the components of *UNC* is the UNC Protocol, an infrastructure for server-less applications and smart contracts powered by a blockchain.
UNC Protocol is built to deliver usability and scalability of modern PaaS like Firebase at fraction of the prices that blockchains like Ethereum charge.

Overall, *UNC* provides a wide range of tools for developers to easily build applications:
 - [JS Client library][js-api] to connect to UNC Protocol from your applications.
 - [Rust][rust-sdk] and [JavaScript/TypeScript][js-sdk] SDKs to write smart contracts and stateful server-less functions.
 - [Numerous examples][examples-url] with links to hack on them right inside your browser.
 - [Lots of documentation][docs-url], with [Tutorials][tutorials-url] and [API docs][api-docs-url].

## Join the Network

The easiest way to join the network, is by using the `make release` command, which you can install as follows:

```
# testnet node init
./target/release/uncd --home ~/.unc  init --chain-id testnet --download-genesis --download-config

# download snapshot data （optional）
## install rclone
```sh
# Mac 
$ brew install rclone

# Linux
$ sudo apt install rclone
```

```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/rclone
$ touch ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf

## rclone config
[unc_aws]
type = s3
provider = AWS
download_url = https://unc-oss.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com
region = us-west-1
acl = public-read
server_side_encryption = AES256
storage_class = STANDARD

## download data
$ rclone copy --no-check-certificate unc_aws:unc-oss/latest ./
$ latest=$(cat latest)
$ rclone copy --no-check-certificate --progress --transfers=6  unc_aws:unc-oss/${latest:?} ~/.unc/data

# node run
$ ./target/release/uncd --home ~/.unc  run
```
